## Read EPUB files in R

Read metadata and textual content of epub files. 

`epubr` provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. E-book metadata and text content are parsed separately and joined together in a tidy, nested tibble data frame. 

E-book formatting is non-standard enough across all literature that no function can curate parsed e-book content across an arbitrary collection of e-books, in completely general form, resulting in a singular, consistently formatted output containing all the same variables.

EPUB file parsing functionality in this package is intended for relatively general application to arbitrary EPUB e-books. However, poorly formatted e-books or e-books with highly uncommon formatting may not work with this package.
Text is read 'as is'. Additional text cleaning should be performed by the user at their discretion, such as with functions from packages like `tm` or `qdap`.

## Installation

Install `epubr` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("epubr")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("leonawicz/epubr")
```

*Note: Prior versions required R >= 3.5.0 due to package dependencies. This is no longer the case, but if using R < 3.5.0, install from GitHub until the next CRAN release.*

## Example

Bram Stoker's Dracula novel sourced from Project Gutenberg is a good example of an EPUB file with unfortunate formatting.
The first thing that stands out is the naming convention using `item` followed by some ordered digits does not differentiate sections like the book preamble from the chapters.
The numbering also starts in a weird place. But it is actually worse than this. Notice that sections are not broken into chapters; they can begin and end in the middle of chapters!

These annoyances aside, the metadata and contents can still be read into a convenient table. Text mining analyses can still be performed on the overall book, if not so easily on individual chapters.

```{r ex}
file <- system.file("dracula.epub", package = "epubr")
(x <- epub(file))

x$data[[1]]
```

```{r is_md, echo = FALSE}
is_md <- knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") == "markdown_github-ascii_identifiers"
```

```{r md_pkg_ref, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", eval = is_md}
cat('## Reference\n####Documentation\n[Complete package reference and function documentation](https://leonawicz.github.io/epubr/)\n\n####Related packages\nUsers may also be interested in the related package, [gutenbergr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gutenbergr), for searching and downloading public domain texts from Project Gutenberg.')
```
