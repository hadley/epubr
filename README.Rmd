Read metadata and textual content of epub files. *Under development.*

`epubr` provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal e-book content from EPUB files. E-book metadata and textual contents are parse separately. 

E-book formatting is non-standard enough across all literature that no function can curate parsed e-book content for an across an arbitrary collection of e-books, in completely general form, resulting in a singular, consistently formatted output. Functions in this package that are intended for relatively general application to arbitrary e-books with *a priori* unknown formatting and metadata structure, do minimal to no processing of the output. They essentially only read the content "as is" and attempt to curate them in a data frame. Some poorly formatted e-books may not be readable by these functions at all.
