Package: epubr
Version: 0.1.0
Title: Read EPUB File Metadata and Text
Description: Provides functions supporting the reading and parsing of internal ebook content from EPUB files. 
    Book metadata and textual contents are parse separately. E-book formatting is non-standard enough across all 
    literature that no function can curate parsed e-book content for an across an arbitrary collection of e-books, 
    in completely general form, resulting in a singular, consistently formatted output. 
    Functions in this package that are intended for relatively general application to arbitrary e-books with a priori 
    unknown formatting and metadata structure, do minimal to no processing of the output. 
    They essentially only read the content "as is" and attempt to curate them in a data frame. 
    Some poorly formatted e-books may not be readable by these functions at all.
